Fostering a sense of belonging is important for encouraging diversity and inclusivity in empowered teams. Leaders should create a culture where all team members feel valued, respected, and supported.

This may involve promoting open communication, providing opportunities for team members to engage in decision-making, and offering support and guidance as needed.
