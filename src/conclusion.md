When team members are given the tools, resources, and support they need to take ownership of their work, they are more engaged, motivated, and invested in their jobs. This leads to increased productivity, creativity, and innovation. Empowered teams also tend to have higher retention rates and are better able to adapt to changes in the workplace.
